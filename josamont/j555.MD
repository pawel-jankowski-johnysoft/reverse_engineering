Simple crackme - password consists only from numbers. Most tricky part is 
conversation numbers between decimal and hexadecimal formats. 
Algorithm converts first bytes to number and store it in ebx register (temporarly,
eax is used to store current char to number). After convert all chars to one number 
stored in ebx, it is moved to eax, divided by 10 and stored under destination address.
Finally value: 
0xde 0xfe 0xca 0x00 
is compared to converted previously number.
Now, it is only needed to convert value to number:

0x00cafede -> to decimal ->  PASSWORD
