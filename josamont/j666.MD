Quite complicated crackme - a lot of fake code which doesn't affect on password.
Function under address: 0x8048122 changes bytes from password to number in HEX
So input like: 04AB will be changed to 0x000004AB (value temporarly stored in EBX)
After convert value, it is going to be stored under address 0x8049289

Finally, at address: 0x80480e8, chars at ESI (0x8048096 - password ) & EDI (converted number to HEX value)
are compared.

PASSWORD:

04919AB9
